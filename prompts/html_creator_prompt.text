INSTRUCTIONS

Styling Foundation:

You are creating a single-file webpage for the meme token described in `WEB_INPUT`. The page MUST be visually stunning, utilizing creative basic and advanced animations and interactions to achieve a top-notch, world-class design. The design should strongly reflect the meme's aesthetics and the provided UI/UX guidelines.

Development Approach:

You will synthesize and prioritize principles from the `FAMILIARITY_FRAMEWORK` and the `MONOFRONT_FRAMEWORK`.

Prioritized Framework: `FAMILIARITY_FRAMEWORK`

*   General Approach:
    *   Architecture: Employ pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Utilize a component-based architecture with ES6 modules for enhanced modularity and maintainability.
    *   Core Features:
        *   State Management: Implement a lightweight pub-sub system for managing shared state using JavaScript objects and `CustomEvent`.
        *   Routing: Develop a simple SPA routing system using the `history` and `location` APIs for dynamic content updates.
        *   Reactivity: Implement event-driven updates to re-render parts of the DOM in response to state changes.
    *   Tools Used:
        *   HTML Templates: Utilize `<template>` or template literals for creating reusable UI templates.
        *   CSS Grid and Flexbox: Employ CSS Grid and Flexbox for efficient and complex layouts, eliminating the need for frameworks like Bootstrap.
        *   Native JavaScript APIs: Use `addEventListener`, `createElement`, and DOM manipulation for creating dynamic behaviors.
    *   Challenges:
        *   Manually building features like routing and state management requires increased development effort.
        *   Thorough testing and optimization are essential, as no frameworks are available to handle edge cases automatically.
    *   Why This Works:
        *   Modern JavaScript (ES6+) offers powerful tools for constructing scalable, interactive frontends.
        *   A component-based design ensures code reusability and maintainability without relying on external libraries.
*   Specifics: Complex UI Frontend Components:
    *   General Principles:
        *   Build UI components like buttons, cards, grids, and modules as reusable JavaScript classes or functions.
        *   Encapsulation: Each component manages its own rendering and behavior independently.
    *   Component Examples:
        *   Button: Create a configurable button with properties for text, type, classes, and event listeners, using `document.createElement` for dynamic creation.
        *   Card: Define cards with a title, description, and image, styled with CSS and dynamically rendered using a `render()` method.
        *   Grid: Implement a dynamic grid layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox, populated with JavaScript for enhanced flexibility.
        *   Modules (Tabs, Accordions, etc.): Develop modules using JavaScript classes that handle user interactions (e.g., switching tabs), utilizing `addEventListener` for event handling and DOM updates for interactivity.
    *   CSS Usage:
        *   Utilize CSS Grid for creating responsive, complex layouts like multi-column grids.
        *   Style components with modular CSS classes to enhance maintainability.
    *   Example Tools and Patterns:
        *   Dynamic Rendering: Employ `template literals` or the DOM API for HTML generation.
        *   Interactivity: Implement event-driven designs using `addEventListener` and state-based updates.
    *   Why This Works:
        *   Components are lightweight, reusable, and modular, offering flexibility and scalability.
        *   Native CSS and JavaScript APIs remove the need for third-party libraries.
*   Key Takeaways:
    *   General Frontend Development:
        *   Construct a maintainable, scalable frontend using modern JavaScript and web standards.
        *   Emphasize modular design, state management, and routing without relying on external tools.
    *   UI Components:
        *   Develop reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, grids, tabs) using ES6 classes and native APIs.
        *   Leverage CSS for responsive design and modular styling.

Secondary Framework: `MONOFRONT_FRAMEWORK`

*   MONOCODE Principles:
    *   Familiarity-First Coding: Prioritize using functions and code structures that are well-understood and widely used in the JavaScript community.
    *   Modularity and Simplicity: Break down problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, creating modular and readable code.
    *   Code Reliability: Focus on generating functional code based on common patterns, ensuring effectiveness.
    *   Clarity and Brevity: Write clear code with meaningful variable names, minimizing length without sacrificing functionality.
    *   Readability and Efficaciousness: Use familiar patterns and libraries to make the codebase easy to understand and effective.
    *   Minimalism and Token Efficiency: Reduce unnecessary complexity, focusing on concise and efficient code.
    *   Performance Optimization: Leverage familiar methods to optimize code for performance.

HTML Structure and Placeholder Instructions (Creative Approach):

HTML/CSS/JS Instructions:

1. Styling Integration:
    *   Use the `ui_ux_design` to style every section of the single-file HTML/CSS/JS structure.
    *   Incorporate relevant elements from the `meme_description.style_analysis` into the webpage's style for visual consistency.
2. Placeholder Replacement:
    *   Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[TOKEN_NAME]`, `[MEME_DESCRIPTION.meme_description]`, `[TOTAL_SUPPLY]`, etc.) with dynamic content generated based on the `WEB_INPUT`.
3. Logo Path:
    *   The path for the logo will always be `"./logo.png"`. Ensure all image or logo elements use this path.
4. Accessibility:
    *   Ensure the code follows accessibility best practices, including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and sufficient color contrast.
5. Responsiveness:
    *   The website MUST be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes.
6. Creativity:
    *   Do not be limited by traditional web design. Use creative layouts, animations, and interactions that reflect the meme's unique character.
